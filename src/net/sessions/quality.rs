//! Per-session connection quality, and the aggregation that turns it into

//!
//! A session's jitter and its client's ASN are per-player facts, so neither can
//! be a metric label: concurrent sessions and the ~9700 ASNs seen in a day of
//! traffic both blow up cardinality. Instead every session registers a
//! [`SessionQuality`] here, the I/O paths stamp packet arrivals onto it, and
//! [`spawn_aggregator`] periodically folds the whole registry into a jitter
//! histogram plus per-ASN aggregates whose series count is bounded by
//! configuration rather than by traffic.
